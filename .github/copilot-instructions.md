# Turbidity Estimation Project Instructions

This project focuses on estimating water turbidity from satellite imagery, specifically for the Roehne river. 

## Key Guidelines:
- Use geospatial libraries (rasterio, geopandas) for satellite data handling
- Implement machine learning models for turbidity prediction
- Follow remote sensing best practices for water quality analysis
- Use Sentinel-2 and Landsat data sources when possible
- Include proper coordinate reference systems (CRS) handling
- Implement data validation and quality checks
- Use appropriate spectral indices for water quality assessment
- Follow scientific methodology for calibration and validation
